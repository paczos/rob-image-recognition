% Output:
% sepplane - row vector of separating plane coefficients
% posmiss - number (coefficient) of misclassified samples of pclass
% negmiss - number (coefficient) of misclassified samples of nclass

	%% 2. Compute separating plane correction 
	%%		This is sum of misclassfied samples coordinate times learning rate 
	%% 3. Modify solution (i.e. sepplane)
